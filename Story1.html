<p><b>So during summer vacation we all plan something adventurous with friends and family.This time i went to visit a few beaches during hot summer . We had lot of fun in the beach waters , making sand castles . After sometime i just sat on the beach gazing at the sky , the clouds which seems to be moving , it was just so mesmerizing beauty just above our head which we never look at .</b> </p>

<p><b>I could just see clouds in the form of a huge bird with sharp beak , huge wings in the light blue sky a pure white bird . Just at the little distance was a ship like structure of the cloud . Does'nt it seem like a travelling ship in the light blue sea(actually light blue sky)and the birds above the ship which could see the whole world from the above.</b> </p>
<p><b>It was such a nice day , such an awesome weather.</b></p>
